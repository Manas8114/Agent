### Description

The Enhanced PoC implements an AI-native multi-agent system integrated with a comprehensive 5G/6G testbed (Open5GS + UERANSIM + Prometheus/Grafana + React Dashboard). The system leverages reinforcement learning, context inference, and real-time user experience monitoring for dynamic decision-making, optimizing network slices and user experience under varying traffic and fault scenarios.

**Key Features:**
• **Context-aware AI**: Detects nuanced anomalies (e.g., signaling floods, slice starvation, gaming lag, streaming buffering) beyond threshold rules
• **User Experience Optimization**: Real-time monitoring of gaming performance (FPS, ping, jitter) and streaming quality (buffering, resolution, startup delay)
• **Intent-based automation**: Operators declare what they want (e.g., "maintain <10ms URLLC latency", "ensure 60+ FPS gaming", "minimize YouTube buffering"), and the agent autonomously enforces policies
• **Explainability**: Each AI action is logged with reasoning for operator trust, including UX impact analysis
• **Resilience optimization**: Fast failover, dynamic scaling, and resource reallocation reduce downtime and operational cost while maintaining optimal user experience
• **Real-time Visualization**: Interactive dashboard with Before/After AI comparison charts and live performance metrics
