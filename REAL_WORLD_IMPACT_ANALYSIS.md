### **Agent Communication Flow**

#### **1. Event Processing Pipeline**
```
Telecom Event → Data Quality Agent → QoS Agent → Failure Agent → 
Traffic Agent → Energy Agent → Security Agent → Actions
```

#### **2. Message Bus Channels**
- **`anomalies.alerts`**: Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- **`optimization.commands`**: Optimization recommendations
- **`actions.approved`**: Coordinator-approved actions
- **`actions.executed`**: Execution results and feedback

#### **3. Inter-Agent Communication Examples**

**Scenario 1: Network Congestion Cascade**
```
1. Traffic Agent detects increasing load
   ↓ (publishes to optimization.commands)
2. Energy Agent receives traffic forecast
   ↓ (calculates power requirements)
3. QoS Agent monitors service degradation
   ↓ (publishes to anomalies.alerts)
4. Failure Agent predicts overload failure
   ↓ (recommends load balancing)
5. System executes coordinated response
```

**Scenario 2: Security Threat Response**
```
1. Security Agent detects suspicious activity
   ↓ (publishes to anomalies.alerts)
2. Data Quality Agent validates threat data
   ↓ (confirms data integrity)
3. QoS Agent monitors impact on services
   ↓ (measures performance degradation)
4. Energy Agent adjusts power to affected cells
   ↓ (isolates compromised equipment)
5. Coordinated threat mitigation executed
```
